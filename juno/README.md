# üì° Juno Node Monitoring ‚Äî Prometheus & Grafana

This section of the `starknet_tools` repository is dedicated to tracking and analyzing metrics for **Juno nodes** ‚Äî the Starknet full node written in Go ‚Äî including optional validator capabilities.

It provides complete resources to help you monitor sync status, validator attestation performance, RPC traffic, and system-level usage. Using **Prometheus and Grafana**, you can maintain visibility and performance over your infrastructure.

## üìÅ Available Resources

- **[Juno Validator Monitoring ‚Äî Prometheus Metrics](https://github.com/Cumulo-pro/starknet_tools/blob/main/juno/attestation_metrics.md)**

   This document describes the specific Prometheus metrics exposed by a Juno node when acting as a validator. It includes detailed explanations of attestation epochs, slots, confirmations, and suggested alert rules to track validator uptime and failures.

- **[Juno Node Metrics Documentation](https://github.com/Cumulo-pro/starknet_tools/blob/main/juno/metrics.md)**

   A comprehensive reference for all metrics exported by Juno via `/metrics`. Includes sync state, RPC request counters, memory usage, and histogram metrics like fetch/store/verify. Recommended for both full nodes and validators.
